I want the project to record, manipulate, and display my scores for all ACT practice tests that I take
Approaches:
    Create a PracticeTest class that records: Date, amountCorrect, amountTotal, Notes, time

PracticeTest class
Specifications:
    - Date field that records the date of the practice tests
    - Amount correct which would represent the numerator in a score or the amount of answers correct of the next field - amountTotal
    - Amount of total questions answered
    - Notes if wanted so I know what to improve
    - time to see if there is any correlation

How will program work??
